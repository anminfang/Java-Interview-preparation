1. Three Object-Oriented Programming Characteristics: Capsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

2. Override VS Overload
Override is happening in superclass and subclass. Such as interface class has a method and another class implements interface will have
the same method but have different action. The name of method and parameters of method should be the same. Overload is happening in the
same class. But, they can have different return data type, parameters etc.
